So here is how the game will work:

1) we have a list of all possible clues. 4 categories, 4 entries per category (arbitrary)
2) we use those clues to create a winning combination, 1 clue per category
3) we generate a single clue, randomly selected per badge. The pool of clues has the winning 4 removed
4) players must collect clues from other attendees, this will remove the clue as a winning piece in the clues_collection file
5) players will eventually be left with 4 clues they never recieved. That is the answer and they can find a badge council person to submit and verify thatâ€™s the combination we generated
